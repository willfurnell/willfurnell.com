During the _event_ a few years ago I had some spare time so bought some Jubilee Line door buttons from the London Transport Museum [online vintage shop](https://www.ltmuseumshop.co.uk/vintage-shop). 
At the time they were very good value and sold unrefurbished.

I wanted to use one to control the Hue bulb in my bedroom, but as the built in circuitry wasn't suitable I designed my own.

Okay, not so much design, moreso completely overengineer.

It has circuitry for controlling the LED light ring, and then an ESP32 that you can program to do whatever you like with the button press.

You can find the PCB design here: [https://github.com/willfurnell/jubilee-button-pcb](https://github.com/willfurnell/jubilee-button-pcb)

And you can find some sample code here: [https://github.com/willfurnell/jubilee-hue](https://github.com/willfurnell/jubilee-hue)

I have some of these laying about, and happy to order more if you are interested in one. Please contact me mail@ this domain
