TAPAS is the Timepix Analysis Platform at School and is a web platform I've been developing over the last couple of years for analysing radiation data from CERN's [Timepix](http://medipix.web.cern.ch/medipix/) detectors. 

I originally developed it for my Extended Project Qualification but now have extended it massively. 

TAPAS is now used by many schools and organisations around the country - and is ready for over 300 schools and their students to analyse scientific data. 
TAPAS will also be the home to data from the [LUCID payload on TechDemoSat-1](http://www.sstl.co.uk/Blog/February-2013/TechDemoSat-1-s-LUCID--a-novel-cosmic-ray-detector) that is currently in orbit.
